### Welcome to: AdDefender!
**AdDefender** is a **free and open-source Framework to defend Ad-Blockers**!

Millions of people have ad blockers installed.
Depending on your target customer group up to 50% use ad blockers.

You serve them your high-quality content whereas they do not see your ads!
This means: No more revenue for you and your business.

AdDefender tries to prevent the user from viewing you website with an ad blocker.
And you decide how it works: 
* You can show you visitors a message if they have an ad blocker or
* You can show a full-size banner, covering you website.

It's you decision. And AdDefender tries to help you!


## Examples / How-To-Use ##
For how to use it, please see the example-files "app-fullbanner.php" and "app-smallbanner.php".
They should explain how AdDefender works...

To test it, you have to access these files using a webserver supporting php, like Apache or XAMPP.

If you need help, please contanct me!

## Can I use AdDefender without PHP? ##
Yes, you can!
For more information to this, please contact the author.

But we suggest you to use the php version if possible, because it provides extended features.

## Licensing etc. ##
You can use AdDefender for any purpose (even for commercial) without any fees etc.

However, a small annotation or reference to this project would be very nice.

Please read also the "License.md"-file.
