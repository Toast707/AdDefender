## The Problem ##
Depending on your target visitor group, up to 50% use an ad blocker. 
This means, ads - the most common and effective way to earn money - are no longer displayed.
You'll lose your revenue.

## The Solution ##
AdDefender has several techniques to deal with ad blockers. You can prevent the user from viewing your site and force him to deactivate the blocker. Or you can show him banners and notifications to make him aware of this problem.
=======
## Examples / How-To-Use ##
For how to use it, please see the example-files "app-fullbanner.php" and "app-smallbanner.php".
They should explain how AdDefender works...

To test it, you have to access these files using a webserver supporting php, like Apache or XAMPP.

If you need help, please contanct me!

## Can I use AdDefender without PHP? ##
