### Willkommen zum AdDefender!
**AdDefender** is a **free and open-source PHP- AND/OR Javascript-Framework to Defend Ad-Blockers**!



## Examples / How-To-Use ##
If you want to see how easy it is to integrate the necessary code to your's, please 
see the Example files 'app-fullbanner.php' and 'app-smallbanner.php'.

Here you will find some examples which work with the most recent version of **uBlock Orgin** and **AdBlock Plus**. It even works with extensions like **NoScript** or with a Browser where the user disabled Javascript:

[*] http://trserver1.site40.net/projects/AdDefender/app-fullbanner.php.html

## Can I use AdDefender without PHP? ##
Yes, you can!
Please see the 'app-fullbanner.php.html' and 'app-smallbanner.php.html' files to see how a 
html-only solution would look like.
It is easy and almost as safe as the php version.

But we suggest you to use the php version if possible, because it provides extended features.

## Licensing etc. ##
You can use AdDefender for any purpose (even for commercial) without any fees etc.

However, a small annotation or reference to this project would be very nice.

Please read also the "License.md"-file.
